# Water-Footprint-of-AI
In this respository, we provide the codebase to estimate the water footprint of AI models from weather data and power generation data from EIA for 5 years from 2019 to 2023.
There are 3 files. One file is to download weather data from weatherunderground website. It gets the hourly data day by day and append it in a dataframe.
The other file is to download EIA power data for each balancing regions for all energy sources in USA.
Finally E_Energy_WUE_calculation_2019_2023-wo_interpolation.ipynb file calculates the water usage effectiveness for AI models from weather data and power generation data.
